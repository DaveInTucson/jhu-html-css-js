# HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Module 2 Assignment

[Assignment specification](Assignment-2.md)

## Assignment:

Basically create a web page using a simple user-implemented responsive CSS framework with three different layouts, depending on the display width.

## Solution:

* Created skeleton files
* Copied responsive framework from lecture 24 (removed green border)
* Implemented and styled the title and menu divs
* Added classes for the required responsive behavior

## Notes and observations

* Most of the work here was figuring out how to style the menu divs.
* I spent more time getting the menu title in the right place than getting the responsive part right.
* Apparently you can't have left or right margins on the cell elements even with `box-sizing: border-box`.
* This was actually a fun little exercise, in spite of how easy it turned out to be. There's something very satisfying about seeing the styling come step by step to what you want.
