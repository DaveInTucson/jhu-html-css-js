# My Version of the restaurant website.

## Motivation

As developed in Lecture 30 and following of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript course.
I was watching the lectures and not really feeling like I was getting much out of
it, so I decided to code my own version of the website in parallel with the videos.

This code is the result of that process.

## Starting point

I started with the contents of the `Lecture30/after` folder. This contains

* Bootstrap v3.3.6 (`css` and `js` files)
* `css/styles.css` containing color, background-color, font-size, and font-family styling for the `body` Starting
* Varous `glyphicons` font files
* `jquery-2.1.4.min.js`
* `npm.js` which contains a bunch of `require` entries to files not included in the course Git repository
* An empty `js/script.js`
* A skeleton `index.html` page

To which I have added this README.md file.

## Implementation notes

* [Coding the Navigation Bar of the Site](CodingNavBar.md)
* [Coding the Homepage and the Footer](CodingHomeAndFooter.md)
* Coding the Restaurant Menu Pages
